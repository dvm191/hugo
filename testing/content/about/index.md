### Who is Dayne Segal?

#### Humble Beginings 

I was born in South Africa, Durban - It is a dosey beach city that has Summer all year round, I moved to London in the United Kingodm in October 2022 and have set about making the big Smoke my home ever since. 

I was always into computers from a young age, The first game i ever played was Diablo 1 way back when, I think I am showing my age there. I always knew that i wanted to embark on a career in tech but at the same time did not a 100% know where to start.

### Career
I am currently employed as a Cloud Operations Engineer/ Devops Engineer for a Data and Analytics company named LexisNexis IP.

I finished School in 2006, I knew what I wanted to do (which was in the tech space) - but not a 100% sure in how I was going to set about achieving it. I started Studing a 2 year Diploma in Information Technology, but due to circumstances out of my control (finances) I was not able to complete the course. I realized that studying a degree was not the correct route for me - I needed to learn in a practical environment where there was not the same financial pressure on my family. So I found a job working as Technical Support engineer for a Small IT company based in Durban. This was my in into the industry, and from there i tried to take in as much knowledge as I could, from working as technical support for a small IT company, I moved to doing a Simialr role for a call Centre - During this time I found myself wanting more then doing Tech support and transitioned into a Cloud Support role with a huge focus on Linux.

In 2018 - I took on a Role at Large Software Development House (Derivco) which was in the Online Gaming Space working as a platforms Engineer, With a focus on supporting the Linux Estate for the entire company as well as sdesigning tools for a microservice architecture. This role the learning curve was steep but this was the space I wanted to be in and thrive. 

In 2024, I am now based in London, UK - I work for a Data and Analytics company (LexisNexis) with a keen use of leveraging AI to make our software. My role is that of a Cloud operations engineer.
